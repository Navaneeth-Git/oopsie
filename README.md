# Impossible Typing Challenge 🎯

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Commitment Issues

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Navaneeth Nandakumar - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Arfan Thafseer - SCMS School of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
This project presents a seemingly simple typing task but randomly introduces subtle errors as the user types. The twist? Users aren’t sure if the typos are their own or if the program is messing with them, creating a funny and confusing experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever been so confident in your typing skills that you wish a program would throw you off balance just to challenge you? The world needs a way to make typing a funny, frustrating experience—and we’re here to deliver.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By subtly altering characters at random times, our program adds just the right amount of uncertainty. With each keystroke, users are left wondering if they made the error or if the system is toying with them. It’s a typing challenge for those who dare!
